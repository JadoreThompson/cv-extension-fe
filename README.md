## **Description**

___

This is the front, with a little bit of backend with JavaScript, end for my cover letter RAG Model. This directory is the intermediary between the client and API built for facilitating and producing the necessary data. 

## Prerequisites

For this to work you’d need access to the API. If you already do. You can go ahead and clone the repo.

## **Tech Stack**

- JavaScript
- HTML

A brief tutorial on how it works. User adds their CV. This’ll be used as a knowledge base for the user as it should have all relevant qualifications for a role. User can then click the envelope icon to reveal the cover letter generation screen where they can drop the drop description and have the program return a cover letter bespoke to them.
